            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am in my fourth year of Software and Biomedical Engineering (iBioMed) at McMaster University. My passion for software development was because of the endless possibilities of self expression in one's work. I enjoy using different kinds of software applications, so why not create some for others to enjoy? In addition, biomedical engineering has allowed me to creatively think and design devices to help others make their day more convenient. The two fields combine both of my passions together.<br>I was fortunate enough to intern at both Honeywell and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, both of which have allowed me to learn a new skillset ranging from soft skills such as collaboration, communication, and working on an interdisciplinary team; as well as technical skills pertaining to software design, software requirements, data structures and algorithms, and more!
