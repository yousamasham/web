            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am going into my third year of Software and Biomedical Engineering (iBioMed) at McMaster University. My passion for software development was due to the endless possibilities of self expression in one's work. I enjoy using all kinds of software applications including many mobile apps, so why not create some for others to enjoy :D ? In addition, biomedical engineering has allowed me to creatively think and design devices to help others overcome what was troubling them. The two fields combined have helped forming me into the person I am today.
